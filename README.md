# Gandaki-River-Basin-Climate-Dynamics-with-CORDEX
R-based project to extract, process, and analyze CORDEX regional climate model data for Gandaki River Basin with visualizations and insights.
This repository contains R scripts designed for analyzing CORDEX and other climate datasets, including, APHRODITE, and ERA5, to evaluate climate trends and project future scenarios for a specific basin. The methodology begins with the preparation of climate datasets, including historical data and future scenarios under RCP pathways. The extracted data undergoes rigorous model evaluation to identify biases on both seasonal and annual scales. Based on this evaluation, the best-performing models are selected using a past performance framework. These selected models are then combined to create an ensemble, ensuring improved accuracy and reliability. The ensemble model is subsequently used to perform comprehensive climate analyses, including trend analysis to identify temporal changes in climate parameters, spatial change analysis to detect geographic variations, future climate projections under different scenarios, and the calculation of extreme climate indices to quantify events like heavy rainfall and heatwaves.
